The major takeaway is that difficulties with shipping products often stem from problems in the work done before building, specifically in the 'shaping' phase. This shaping work, which involves deciding what to build, is often done through methods like PRDs (Product Requirements Documents) and Figma files, but these can lead to issues during the building phase.

Here's a breakdown of the key issues and solutions:

*   **Problems with Traditional Shaping:**
    *   **Figma Files:** While visually detailed, Figma files lack the underlying logic and implementation details necessary for engineers, often leading to rework and the realisation that the design isn't buildable as drawn. They also don't always show all the different use cases and scenarios.
    *   **PRDs:** Requirements documents often focus on high-level outcomes without specifying how to achieve them, leading to uncertainty, scope creep, and a lack of clarity on what to actually build. They also make it easy to add to the scope without considering the cost or difficulty of implementing those features.

*   **A Better Approach: Live Shaping Sessions**
    *   **Collaboration:** Shaping sessions should involve all necessary perspectives (e.g., product manager, engineer, designer) in the same room at the same time to reveal issues early.
    *   **Concrete:** The focus should be on specific solution ideas, allowing for the identification of potential problems early in the process.
    *   **Lightweight:** The work should be easily changeable and not feel like wasted effort when modifications are made.

*   **Breadboarding Technique:**
    *   **User Perspective:** Breadboarding involves mapping out how the system works entirely from the user's perspective.
    *   **Places, Affordances, and Flows:** The system is described using 'places' (screens or interface locations), 'affordances' (actions a user can take), and 'flows' (connections from actions to places).
    *   **Iteration:** By visually mapping out the current version of a system, the team can identify pain points and then iterate through new versions to improve on the user experience. This technique is easy to plug into an existing process without needing to change anything else.

*   **Benefits of Effective Shaping**
    *   **Clarity:** All team members will have more clarity about their roles and goals.
    *   **Engineers Unblocked:** Engineers can see the necessary wiring and logic for the system early on, even if detailed designs are not yet finalised.
    *   **Designers on Solid Ground:** Designers can focus on creating visually appealing designs knowing the foundational aspects have been validated.
    *   **Continuous Progress:** Work feels like it's constantly adding up, rather than going back and forth due to missed requirements and design flaws.

By using a technique like breadboarding during a live shaping session, teams can identify and address potential problems earlier in the development process, leading to more effective shipping and better overall outcomes.
